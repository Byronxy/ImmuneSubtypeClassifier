-1.  What should be done with NAs in the incoming data? 0s?

0. Parameters to optimize:
   -- reducing number of needed genes to minimum
   -- break points for binning genes
   -- eta, max depth
   -- ensemble size (want it not too big) for speed of calling
   -- ptail -- the proportion of genes to select
   -- allow overlapping genes across subtype models? or hard partitions?
   -- included genes ... just use immune genes?

1. Switch to turn off feature selection... maybe just make ptail=1?
   -- and skip the rank sum test if ptail=1

2. Allow entrez IDs or gene symbols (two fit models?)   ### or ensembl!

3. Allow for missing genes.
   -- fill in matrix with empty values for missing genes.
   -- think model expects a column named g_i

4. Drop genes that are not in any model.. smaller models
     X (R script in test dir) have to gather list of features across all models --
     -- when new data comes in with missing genes
        -- print warning
        -- add them to the matrix as zeros.

5. Just binning gene values did not translate well to another gene quantification...
   -- will try gene pairs based on most important genes
