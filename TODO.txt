0. Parameters to optimize:
   -- reducing number of needed genes to minimum
   -- break points for binning genes
   -- eta, max depth
   -- ensemble size (want it not too big) for speed of calling
   -- ptail -- the proportion of genes to select
   -- allow overlapping genes across subtype models? or hard partitions?
   -- included genes ... just use immune genes?

1. Switch to turn off feature selection.

2. Allow entrez IDs or gene symbols (two fit models?)

3. Allow for missing genes.

4. Drop genes that are not in any model.. smaller models
     -- have to gather list of features across all models --
     -- when new data comes in with missing genes
        -- print warning
        -- add them to the matrix as zeros.

5. feature importance ...
   -- given 800 genes in a model
   -- only have Gain scores for ~200 and most of them are very very low.

    fi <- xgboost::xgb.importance(model=ens[[1]][[1]]$bst)
