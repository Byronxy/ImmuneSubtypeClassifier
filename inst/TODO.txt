-1.  What should be done with NAs in the incoming data? 0s?
     I have made the missing genes be random 0,1 draws, as not
     to give any additional information one way or another, but
     will make the classifier happy, since that feature is present.

0. Parameters to optimize:
   -- reducing number of needed genes to minimum
   -- break points for binning genes
   -- eta, max depth
   -- ensemble size (want it not too big) for speed of calling
   -- ptail -- the proportion of genes to select
   -- allow overlapping genes across subtype models? or hard partitions?
   -- included genes ... just use immune genes?

X-done. Allow for missing genes.
   -- fill in matrix with empty values for missing genes.
   -- think model expects a column named g_i


6. XX take informative genes from binned expression model
   XX take genes from immune signatures used for orig. immune subtyping
   XX use informative genes as centers to generate top-scoring-pairs style features
      i.e.  For a given sample, in subtype 2, gene_i is informative, then the signature genes are binned to 0,1 based on
            whether they're higher or lower in expression compared to the center gene. This includes the other informative
            genes as well.
